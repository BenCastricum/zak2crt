We cannot use a routine located in basic or kernal rom space to copy cart contents.

The games uses interrupts to force a splitscreen, also while loading from disk.

The ISR table at $0300 is overwritten by the sectors read from disk.

We cannot leave interrupts on while reading from cartridge because we need to
enable kernal rom as well, which in its turn uses the overwritten ISR vector
at $0314.


Current issues:

Loading/Saving of games is not working anymore. Probably due to some code
being overwritten by the disk emulation code. Need to find a place to put
the code safely.

Game shows glitches while loading. Caused by the interupt being disabled
causing timing issues with the splitscreen. We currently work around this by
loading sectors while the vic is drawing the borders. On PAL this seems to
work, on NTSC it still glitches. There's not much border on NTSC systems.
