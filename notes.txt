We cannot use a routine located in basic or kernal rom space to copy cart contents.

The games uses interrupts to force a splitscreen, also while loading from disk.

The ISR table at $0300 is overwritten by the sectors read from disk.

We cannot leave interrupts on while reading from cartridge because we need to
enable kernal rom as well, which in its turn uses the overwritten ISR vector
at $0314.

Another solution might be to move the put make the current interrupt at $FFFE
callable with kernel rom enabled by redirecting it to a new code that
changes $01 to #$15, reads the interupt vector at $fffe, calls that interrupt
when done, restore $01 with previous value ($17 most likely) and continues
For this to work we still need to address the issue that the sector data is
stored at $0300-$03ff

The original disk handling code should remain useable, which means we need to
find a new (unused) space for our code. When the game request disk '0' then
call the original code. Disk 0 a load/save game disk apparently.
